# PowerBI-projects
Welcome to this repository showcasing the Power BI projects I completed during a Data Analytics Bootcamp. Each project represents a real analytical case with data modeling, DAX calculations, visual insights, and business-driven conclusions.
This repository includes multiple Power BI dashboards demonstrating skills in:
Data cleaning and transformation (Power Query)
Data modeling (Star Schema, relationships)
DAX calculations (CALCULATE, FILTER, iterators, aggregations)
Building interactive and visually clear reports
Business metric analysis: sales, marketing, unit economics, cohort analysis
Dashboard optimization and UX-focused design
